# Headspace
### Liam Juskevice
### Computational Creativity Spring 2021
So I have 0 experience making music but I attempted to make a song. It doesn't exactly fit the specifications for being "relaxing", but I think it does a decent job capturing where I've been at for the past week or so. I didn't upload the samples I used to github so you can't 100% recreate this using the code as is. 

Regardless, this is my song, Headspace, and the code I used to create it. It features a low ringing sound throughout to represent tinnitus, which I sometimes have. This is capturing those fun partially sleep deprived nights where I'm banging out an honors thesis or other project... or maybe putting things off before I have to get serious about it. At one point I felt like I was starting to hear things, which ended up being kinda recreated as the long drawn out two note thing seen throughout much of this song. 

I also played around with music samples a bit, and these particular ones get stuck in my head pretty often these days. Otherwise this song is mostly me just playing around with a few ideas. I've got build ups that don't go anywhere, a few different progressions I came up with, and tried putting them together to see what happens. Honestly these progressions don't play off each other all that well, but we're not talking about an especially harmonious headspace here. So yeah, that's the basic idea of the song, enjoy... or don't.
